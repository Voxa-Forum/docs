0:49

on its main repository many big names

0:52

are using it to manage their Community

0:54

such as epic games figma and atlassian

0:57

let's have a look at the product itself

0:58

to understand why it is such a success

1:01

in the open source ecosystem you have

Setup options

1:04

different options available to set up

1:07

your own discourse instance the first

1:09

one is to go to discourse.org click on

1:12

build your community and you have the

1:15

pricing you can create your own instance

1:18

in the discourse Cloud very easily the

1:21

second option is to go to discourse on

1:23

GitHub

1:24

then to follow the instruction to set it

1:27

up on your own server

1:30

and the way we will do it together is

1:32

using lsto our platform to set up the

1:36

instance in one click

1:38

and the main benefits are to have

1:40

automatic backups and automatic updates

1:43

hit login deploy my first service search

1:47

for discourse

1:50

select then select your cloud provider

1:53

you region your plan hit next take the

1:57

support you need I will keep the default

1:59

one and hit create service

2:01

now we will receive an email as soon as

2:04

our instance is deployed and ready so I

2:07

just received the email telling me that

2:09

the instance is ready go to click here

2:12

to get the password

2:13

once you land on the instance dashboard

2:16

you can copy the password to the

2:18

clipboard and click here to get access

2:20

to your instance this is what you see

2:23

when you arrive for the first time of

2:25

course there is already content provided

2:28

by this course but we are not logged in

2:31

yet so hit login

2:33

right root which is the default account

2:36

that lso creates and paste the password

2:39

from my clipboard and hit login

2:42

so now we have access to new content

Platform overview

2:45

which is the staff category because we

2:48

are the administrator and because of the

2:51

rights on that account we have access to

2:54

this content

2:55

as some default content is here the most

2:59

interesting one is the admin quick start

3:01

guide so let's have a look at it on the

3:04

top we have a banner telling us to

3:06

invite users but I recommend you first

3:09

to set up your instance and then invite

3:12

people to join it what does it tell so

3:16

getting started the admin dashboard

3:19

which we will have a look later the

3:22

staff which is what we saw when we

3:25

logged in as the root admin

3:28

there are different type of stuff admins

3:31

and moderators by default but you can

3:33

expand it

3:35

you can enable social logins so either

3:38

with different providers like Google and

3:41

Twitter but you can also enable SSO and

3:45

also you can make it transparent for

3:47

your users if you have an application

3:49

you can just do a bridge with your token

3:53

to automatically authenticate them you

3:56

can read more of it when you will want

3:58

to set up your instance but let's have a

4:00

look at the admin panel when you arrive

4:03

you have access to some metrics so the

4:06

sign up the topic the posts there is one

4:10

sign up which is that account created by

4:12

default the topics and the posts are the

4:16

one created also by default

4:18

so let's go to the settings from there

4:21

you can customize a lot of things on

4:23

your instance it's very easy to

Customization

4:26

customize so let's name it lsto and add

4:30

some branding so I will change the logo

4:32

and I will also change the small logo of

4:35

the icon perfect I can apply it

4:42

and by default it generates the other

4:45

versions

4:46

let's reload

4:49

and now we have our logo on the top

4:54

you can see it's a bit zoomed in it's

4:56

because it's more visible to you when I

4:58

record my screen but by default it looks

5:01

like this

5:02

okay let's zoom in the back there are a

5:05

lot of other options you can set up

5:09

you can set up the login options so if

5:11

you want invite only login required if

5:15

you must approve users to be part of it

5:18

it is a very flexible and you can see

5:23

that the creators think of almost

5:26

everything and if ever you have a use

5:28

case not present on it because it's open

5:31

source you can

5:33

upgraded and fit to your needs let's

5:36

have a look at users by default there

5:39

are those ones

5:41

you can search them based on different

5:44

tags you can export them create groups

5:47

by default there is the admins and

5:50

moderators which are part of the stuff

5:53

if I'm correct and you have a trust

5:55

system so if a user didn't post anything

6:00

didn't interact with the community you

6:03

won't let that person be able to create

6:06

a new topic and you can specify Your

6:11

Role to what you want to be in your

6:13

community there are also badges which is

6:16

a very good tool to engage your

6:18

community because if you have rewards

6:21

when you do some actions your users will

6:26

more likely interact with others on the

6:28

community and it will add a live so

6:31

there are default ones but of course you

6:33

can create new and customize it as much

6:36

as you need there are a lot of other

6:39

options such as email you can customize

6:42

it as much as you want you have the logs

6:46

of everything that happened on your

6:49

instance and this is very useful you can

6:52

customize it to what we did but you can

6:54

add more customization let's have a look

6:58

at Unreal Engine Community it looks very

7:01

different from what we have but it is

7:04

discourse so with some work you can

7:06

achieve same results or any results you

7:10

want to do you also have API and

7:12

webhooks access you can install plugins

7:16

so by default there is this one but

7:19

there is a guide on how to install

7:21

plugins and what is great is that this

7:25

guide com comes from this course

7:27

community and this course Community is

7:30

this course instance

7:32

so you can follow it and everything is

7:35

explained and you can also find plugins

Your first post

7:38

so let's dive into the main part of it

7:43

which is the topic creation and writing

7:46

content so you can spread it into

7:48

different categories you can create your

7:52

categories and explain what it is what

7:55

to Saints inside what not to say

7:58

but let's start just by creating a basic

8:01

topic by default it's a short version so

8:06

let's expand it

8:08

a great thing is that you can use a

8:11

markdown BB code or HTML

8:14

so it's quite handy based on the way you

8:17

like to create posts welcome to the

8:21

community

8:22

I want it to be bold

8:26

um enjoy the time here are you happy to

8:31

be here and there are some plugins

8:34

available by default like the poll

8:37

so yes

8:40

no

8:41

I insert it oh we don't have the preview

8:44

yet because

8:46

here we have a getting starting guide I

8:49

think you can edit it but in the default

8:52

one so let's close it and here we have

8:55

the preview with the poll available okay

8:58

so let's hit create topic and it's

9:00

telling me that a title is required so

9:03

welcome to LSU community

9:08

created it automatically open the post

9:12

but we can also see it in the list of

9:15

the general topics

9:17

here it is in addition to that you also

9:21

have a different way of communicating so

9:23

you can create on a profile and either

9:26

send a message to the inbox of the user

9:31

so right here

9:34

9:38
