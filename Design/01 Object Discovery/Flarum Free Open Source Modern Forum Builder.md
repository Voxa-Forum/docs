in our last video we discovered this

0:02

course a great platform to build

0:04

community but at lsto we also like to

0:06

highlight less the most yet very

0:08

improvising open source software hi

0:11

let's explore flaream a free and open

0:13

source platform to build discussion

0:15

forums it has three main benefits it's

0:18

lightweight very extensible and the last

0:21

but not least simple to use the best

0:24

place to discover what to expect from it

0:26

is directly Flareon Community let's

0:29

start by installing it to set up flareum

0:31

you have two options the first one is to

Setup options

0:34

host it yourself so go to their GitHub

0:36

autostar for the support and follow the

0:39

installation instruction and set it up

0:42

either on your device or on your own

0:44

server

0:47

the second option is to use your

0:49

favorite hosting provider and together

0:51

we will use LCL so go to ls.io hit login

0:57

then go to deploy my first service

1:02

search for flareum and hit select

1:06

select your cloud provider

1:09

your settings

1:11

the service plan and hit next

1:14

then you can select different level of

1:16

support I would keep the default one

1:18

and then create service I will receive

1:21

an email as soon as my instance is ready

1:23

I just received an email telling me that

1:26

my incense is ready so I go to click

1:29

here to get the password

1:31

once I arrive on the admin dashboard I

1:34

have a link to the instance the username

1:36

which is my lso account email and the

1:39

password I copy it and I go to my

1:41

instance

Platform overview

1:43

so this is what it looks like when you

1:45

arrive for the first time so it's empty

1:48

and we just have to feed it let's start

1:51

by logging with the account we have and

1:54

we know it's at the main admin account

1:58

remember me and login

2:01

okay so I am an administrator but just

2:04

let's start by creating content

2:07

start a discussion

2:08

I will expand it we have a title and

2:12

some text it's quite basic and simple

2:15

but by default this is what we have

2:18

welcome to lsto hello

2:22

Welcome to our community let's talk

2:27

about

2:28

devops and open source software and post

2:34

discussion

2:36

and then here I have my first

2:38

conversation on this instance

2:42

if you're good with just that simple

2:45

text and content you have nothing more

2:49

to do it's out of the box already but

2:52

there are many options to customize it

2:54

so let's have a look at the admin

2:55

dashboard

2:56

settings is my personal settings and

2:58

administration is only me who have

3:01

access to it so let's go to it

Customization

3:04

so the dashboard it's telling me the

3:06

version of flareum on what it is hosted

3:09

so PHP MySQL and the features we will

3:12

have a look at it later but let's

3:14

configure and customize it

3:17

so Basics the name of the Forum

3:20

let's name it elestial community

3:25

talk about Dev Ops and open source

3:29

software

3:30

the welcome Banner what we saw before we

3:33

can change it welcome to lseo

3:37

uh hop over to

3:40

discuss with us okay let's save the

3:45

changes and let's go back to

3:47

the instance

3:49

so here we have the title we have the

3:52

banner that we can close

3:54

but we can go way further

3:58

let's jump to appearance we can edit the

4:01

colors so I don't know the exact color

4:04

but just let's set it

4:08

now the title is orange the button two

4:11

we can set up dark mode so let's have a

4:13

look at what it is

4:15

if you prefer me I'm not a big dark mode

4:18

fan but I know a lot of You Are

4:21

and we can also edit the logo

4:24

so now we have the logo on the top left

4:26

instead of the title we can also edit

4:29

the header and the footer with HTML so

4:31

we can build our own and add custom

4:34

style CSS here

Plugins

4:37

now let's have a look at the features

4:39

available on the dartboard so there is

4:42

approval Emoji so let's add some of them

4:45

Emoji for example

4:47

okay

4:50

um which one we will add the likes

4:56

okay mentions

5:05

and the ties

5:07

enable

5:11

so before seeing the other plugins in

5:13

action let's have a look at what are the

5:15

types by default

5:18

the discussions are not categorized

5:20

because here it works with tags so by

5:24

default its primary targets General so

5:27

you can say it's General we can edit the

5:30

color

5:31

let's say we want to make it Orange

5:38

save changes but let's add another one

5:40

let's say it's support because

5:43

this topic is about uh requiring help

5:47

let's select a red color and here we can

5:50

add a font awesome icon so if you know

5:52

how it works it's easy if not you can go

5:54

to their website and see if the

5:57

available icons

5:59

so FIS and let's add a range so here you

6:04

have a preview on the top

6:06

we can save

6:08

so now when we go to the main page we

6:11

have the tags on the left so it looks

6:14

like categories by its name tags if we

6:17

go to each

6:19

it's empty because we didn't set any

6:21

contents yet and we also have this view

6:24

of tags it's like a category page

6:27

so to not make it empty let's edit the

6:29

tags on the first one so you can say

6:32

it's general or we can bypass type

6:34

requirements and add two of them and it

6:37

will combine them nicely and now if we

6:40

go to one it works we can see the

6:42

general one

6:43

okay so we added some plugins to edit

6:46

the content so let's have a look at it

6:48

uh go to it

6:50

edit now we have mentions

6:54

we also have

6:58

some images but it's weird what it looks

7:01

like but okay maybe I need to go to the

7:04

settings to be able to to have more but

7:07

now to edit the content it's not easy

7:09

because if I want a title if I want both

7:11

text it's not set up by default so let's

7:13

go to the plugins again and let's add

7:16

markdown

7:22

now if we go to edit it

7:29

we have all those options available

7:32

so let's say welcome I want it to be a

7:36

header so you see in the preview here

7:39

it's better

7:40

let's say I want to add an image it's

7:43

not an uploader but you can use services

7:45

to add images

7:47

for example let's use image your

7:53

let's add this cut

7:56

so a cut and the images in this path

8:00

let's save and now we have a title an

8:04

image and content available here

Documentation

8:07

now let's have a look at Flareon

8:09

documentation which is very useful and

8:12

it will help you if you want to go

8:14

further and how to customize or add

8:16

plugins

8:17

you also have some parts that encourage

8:20

you to contribute to it so either if you

8:23

want to be part of an open source

8:25

project or if you need to build specific

8:30

features for you that can benefit the

8:32

other

8:33

you also have access to a rest API so if

8:36

you need to authenticate your users

8:39

manually you can use it or if you need

8:42

to post content automatically

Conclusion

8:44

if you need to choose between flare or

8:47

discourse it really is a matter of taste

8:50

because both are really customer stable

8:53

and really easy to use and mature so you

8:56

can go wrong with both solution

8:59
